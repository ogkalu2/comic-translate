## Intro
Many Automatic Manga Translators exist. Very few properly support comics of other kinds in other languages. 
This project was created to utilize the ability of State of the Art (SOTA) Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and translate comics from all over the world. Currently, it supports translating to and from English, Korean, Japanese, French, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Russian, German, Dutch, Spanish and Italian. It can translate to (but not from) Turkish, Polish, Portuguese and Brazillian Portuguese.

## The State of Machine Translation
For a couple dozen languages, the best Machine Translator is not Google Translate, Papago or even DeepL, but a SOTA LLM like GPT-4o, and by far. 
This is very apparent for distant language pairs (Korean<->English, Japanese<->English etc) where other translators still often devolve into gibberish.

## Installation
### Python
Install Python 3.12. Tick "Add python.exe to PATH" during the setup.
```bash
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```
Install git
```bash
https://git-scm.com/
```
Install uv
```
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
```

Then, in the command line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ogkalu2/comic-translate
cd comic-translate
uv init --python 3.12
```
and install the requirements
```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt --compile-bytecode
```

To Update, run this in the comic-translate folder
```bash
git pull
uv init --python 3.12 (Note: only run this line if you did not use uv for the first time installation)
uv add -r requirements.txt --compile-bytecode
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, then it is recommended to run
```bash
uv remove torch torchvision
uv pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
Note: The 126 in cu126 represents the CUDA version - 12.6. Replace 126 with your CUDA version (or the version closest to yours). E.g 118 if you are running CUDA 11.8

## Usage
In the comic-translate directory, run
```bash
uv run comic.py
```
This will launch the GUI

### Tips
* If you have a CBR file, you'll need to install Winrar or 7-Zip then add the folder it's installed to (e.g "C:\Program Files\WinRAR" for Windows) to Path. If it's installed but not to Path, you may get the error, 
```bash
raise RarCannotExec("Cannot find working tool")
```
In that case, Instructions for [Windows](https://www.windowsdigitals.com/add-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-11-10/), [Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/), [Mac](https://techpp.com/2021/09/08/set-path-variable-in-macos-guide/)

* Make sure the selected Font supports characters of the target language
* v2.0 introduces a Manual Mode. When you run into issues with Automatic Mode (No text detected, Incorrect OCR, Insufficient Cleaning etc), you are now able to make corrections. Simply Undo the Image and toggle Manual Mode.
* In Automatic Mode, Once an Image has been processed, it is loaded in the Viewer or stored to be loaded on switch so you can keep reading in the app as the other Images are being translated.
* Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to Zoom otherwise Vertical Scrolling
* The Usual Trackpad Gestures work for viewing the Image
* Right, Left Keys to Navigate Between Images

## API Keys
To following selections will require access to closed resources and subsequently, API Keys:
* GPT-4o or 4o-mini for Translation (Paid, about $0.01 USD/Page for 4o)

## How it works
### Speech Bubble Detection and Text Segmentation
[speech-bubble-detector](https://huggingface.co/ogkalu/comic-speech-bubble-detector-yolov8m), [text-segmenter](https://huggingface.co/ogkalu/comic-text-segmenter-yolov8m). Two yolov8m models trained on 8k and 3k images of comics (Manga, Webtoons, Western) respectively.

### Inpainting
A [Manga/Anime finetuned](https://huggingface.co/dreMaz/AnimeMangaInpainting) [lama](https://github.com/advimman/lama) checkpoint to remove text detected by the segmenter. Implementation courtsey of [lama-cleaner](https://github.com/Sanster/lama-cleaner)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cVVGVXp.jpg" width="49%"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bLkPyqG.jpg" width="49%">

### Translation
Currently, this supports using GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, DeepL, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Haiku, 
Gemini-1.5-Flash, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Yandex, Google Translate and Microsoft Translator.

All LLMs are fed the entire page text to aid translations. 
There is also the Option to provide the Image itself for further context. 

### Text Rendering
Wrapped text in bounding boxes obtained from bubbles and text.
